LouRawls
========

Event router for light-weight JS projects based on AOP.

Currently in active development.
Currently NOT seeking users.
Currently PASSING unit tests.

### Features

LouRawls plans to distinguish itself from other frameworks by focusing on AOP
and making Events first class citizens in app writing. By utilising Aspects
explicitly at application creation, the programmer can leverage JavaScript's
prototypical inheritence and share command and control functions between
aspects. The treatment of Events as first class citizens in the language
further exposes the quirks of JavaScript as strengths for the developer.
